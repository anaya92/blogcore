                    i believe that some people are just born to lose. i think i am too. my dad always used to joke that i was born a crybaby and stuff like that --
                    not that i think he meant it seriously, but i think it just is true. that somehow i am destined to fall last, naturally. be unlucky, make all the
                    wrong choices. i think of people i've hurt with my actions.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    i think mr booz is a good example of that. i dislike him and find him ugly even to mention in my writings but i cannot help but to think we are somehow the same in
                     spite of our rivalry. it's just one of those god's irony things. that's why i empathize with him. he is a dying man and i see myself in him.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    college makes me feel like shit. i don't like it here. it's not like i would be any better off in virginia. i'm equally purposeless here nor there. i think i've been
                    so used to some bullshit going on in my life constantly i don't have a concept of self-fulfilling happiness when there isn't some (usually woman-related) calamity just
                    around the corner.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    it's only been a couple days of classes and i'm bored out of my mind. i can't focus in these stupid ass lecture halls with 150 people in them. for the time being ALL my
                    classes are more or less review of stuff i did in high school or stuff i already know like introductory C++.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    hopefully there's gonna be something to do on the weekend. sm busywork. life seems so boring and monotonous.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    equally related to loserhood is ugliness. i don't feel good about the way i look. i feel like i'm third class in everything. at least i'm myself, right?<br/>
                    <br/>
                    i need be more creative. i need to work out more. i need to work more w/ godot like i wanted to. i need to blog consistently. i need to edit my video.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    and damn i need a cigarette.<br/>

                    yesterday i was feeling feverish and it was just the absolute fucking worst. i'm all alone and i have no food, and i don't have anybody to care for me.
                    it was such a hassle just to get food and i was so so depressed. but i'm all better now. i'm glad i knew how to take care of myself !!

                    it's not like i have a somebody to love me in virginia, i just want a girlfriend again. i don't think i'm over the last one at all, but still. it would be nice to have a friend to tell me
                    what to do and what to wear and to dress up and go out with. also i like being in the presence of a pretty woman.
                    it makes me very happy.<br/>
