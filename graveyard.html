                    just like he used to always bring up stories of his exes, i keep having dreams about my ex girlfriends.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    i miss them both so much. i can't go back on the mistakes i have made but i wish i could apologize to the both of them, and do what i should've known
                    to. i want to give them peace. i think it will balance my soul's karma. but that's not why i want to. i think i will love them forever in some way or
                    another. i want them to be happy. i wish i could make them feel my love for them, but my opportunity has past.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    in college, the mindset is completely different about girls. it's all about the fast life. but i don't think i'm ever gonna have a true friend like i did
                    with the girls i dated in high school. both were very special and were uniquely dysfunctional with me.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    i know the second would hate me for having grouped her with the other. i wish i cared for her like she needed me to. i know that in the midst of it all i did
                    what i could and i wasn't capable of what i am now, but i wish i somehow could have. she was not perfect, but she was my girl. i loved her until i couldn't.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    the one before has gone on to live her life, as she should. she is strong and smart and i know she will be fine, but i hope she will be happy soon. i wronged her,
                    and i wish i could apologize for my behavior. she tried harder for me than what i deserved.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    they are both beautiful people. if the second one reads this ur the best, don't worry. if the first reads this, i'm sorry and i hope ur doing well and are still doing
                    ur pediatric surgeon plan -- u will do great!! ur a good person. second one do not be mad at me!!! i miss(ed) you. and ur temper and all ur quicks actually. fuck i wish i could bring u back
                    and put u on a pedestal. it's what u wanted. that's why <a href="http://statle.33worlds.net">this</a> exists. shhhh. ;)<br/>
